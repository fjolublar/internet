# Gmail Trick

Add a `+` after your email address when you give it to some sign up site:

```
example+something@gmail.com
```

All emails you receive will be sent to your address but with `sent to` tag being : `example+something@gmail.com`

You can use this trick to automatically sort/label emails that you get from that specific site.

Also, spam or add emails that you get will have the added tag and you will know which site sold your email address.
