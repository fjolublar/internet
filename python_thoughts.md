# automatic formatting of python code

Constistency for consistencies sake is not a good reason to add autoformatting in python.

It is better to focus on writting good code than having consistent formatting of bad code.

`A Foolish Consistency is the Hobgoblin of Little Minds` from [pep-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length):

```
However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!

Some other good reasons to ignore a particular guideline:

- When applying the guideline would make the code less readable, even for someone who is used to reading code that follows this PEP.
```

Autoformatting can make the code base less readable and more difficult to work with.

Autoformatting would remove the need to ask the team and come up with a style that works for the team.

I would heighly recommend to watch this presentation [Beyond PEP 8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M) from Raymond Hettinger, on the the core python developers.
